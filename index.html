   <h2>Stumbling start</h2>
   <p>The beginning of my life in the workforce was less than auspicious, to say the least. I had just started loading trailers for a major shipping company when, at the instruction of a supervisor, I unknowingly violated a work safety regulation. Though the mistake was unintentional (and at the request of my supervisor), I was fired, less than a month after I had started. As it was summer and I was in between classes, I had little to occupy my time until a friend asked me to help with a volunteer project at our old school. We would be working with one of the teachers to repair a roof on a building our school had just purchased. While I wasn't excited by the prospect of intense unpaid manual labor, I thought it best to stay busy and reluctantly agreed to help. </p>

     <h2>Unexpected Turn of Events</h2>
     <p> I'm incredibly grateful now that I did agree as this was one of the best experiences of my life. Over that summer, we removed heavy capstones from the roof, tore out the tar coating, replaced it with a new roll roofing, and did various other projects around the grounds. I worked with a great group of people, learned and laughed more than my fair share, and was able to give back to people who had given me so much. My time on this project wound to a close when my teacher recommended me for a position handling fulfillment for a small publishing company affiliated with our school. Based largely on the strength of his recommendation and a short interview, I got the job and found myself ending the summer in a different shipping job than I began it in.</p>
   <h2>Finding Footing</h2>

   <p> This opportunity would prove dramatically different from the first job. The company was small, with just two facilities and only one other person working at the location where I was. Because the company was small, I would be handling the entirety of the fulfillment operation independently. As such, I found myself responsible for a warehouse with tens of thousands of dollars of inventory and equipment, as well as an entire section of the company's operation and reputation. At 18, with little prior experience, this was a scary prospect, and one which helped me grow immensely. </p>

   <p>While my time at this company was not without turbulence, it (much like my summer spent volunteering) unexpectedly became one of the most positive experiences of my life and one I shall always cherish. Over the following 7 years, I would work at this company in various capacities: full time for around a year, part time while I returned to school and looked for work, and even further part time work after I began a full time job following college.</p>

   <h2>On My Way...</h2>

   <p>While my time with this company was an incredible source of personal development, I still had a lot of fundamental things to learn about the professional world. Due to how informally I obtained the position and the size of the company, I had little exposure to the job search process or to working with a bigger team. After several months of unsuccessful interviews and lackluster job offers, I became discouraged by the process and placed fewer applications. One day, I was notified of an opening that seemed very promising. Being in an "optimistic" frame of mind, I put in an application, expecting to never hear back. To my surprise, I was given an interview which, as I left, I was sure I had entirely bombed. Looking back on all of this, I should have learned to stop trusting my expectations - I was offered the job less than two hours after leaving the interview. While the beginning was rough and full of anxiety and discomfort, I have now found my stride, not only in my role with the company, but as a more confident and professional person. </p>
   <h2>Just Not Sure Where</h2>
   <p id="testP" class="funParagraph"> This is where I find myself now. While I have loved the job I am currently in, there is little room for further advancement. Due to that, and the need to challenge myself, I have found myself not only evaluating a potential change of employment, but possibly of career paths. After years away from organized learning, I enrolled in LaunchCode and am currently planning to return to college part time to obtain an IT degree. As I stand at what often feels like too many forks in the road, I look back on the story I've told, and remind myself to take things one day at a time, be grateful for what I've received, and be open to what may come my way. &#128516; </p>
